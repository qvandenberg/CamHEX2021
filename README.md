# CamHEX2021
Repository for the Cambridge HEX 2021 event for the Optiver trading challenge.

## Run instructions
`python src/AlgoPassive.py`

## Collaboration instructions
This code runs in a virtual environment (venv or conda) that is described by the `requirements.txt` file. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html for details. Below instructions are for using pip on a Linux/OS X system. Use the link for a Windows system with conda.

<ol>
  <li>Create new (empty) Python 3 environment on your local system, e.g. `python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment` </li>
  <li>Activate your environment: `source </path/to/new/virtual/environment>/bin/activate` </li>
  <li>Navigate to path where you want to clone this repository </li>
  <li>git clone <http link> to clone this repository to your system</li>
  <li>Enter root folder of repository</li>
  <li>Install all existing dependencies of the project into your venv: `pip install requirements.txt`</li>
  <li>If you add new packages/dependencies, install them the regular way while you are in your venv. Then to add them to the `requirements.txt` file, use a command like `pip freeze > requirements.txt` so that new packages are added. </li>
  <li> Commit changes and push/pull request to remote repository</li>
</ol>

A possible 5th: Inbalance in the order book. I couldn't find an easy-to-read article so quickly, but generally the buy vs sell order volume says something about near-future price movements too.
